            <h2>How to Recycle Plastic</h2>
            <p>Recycling plastic is essential for protecting our environment and conserving resources. Plastics are widely used in everyday life, but improper disposal can cause serious harm. By recycling, you help reduce pollution, save energy, and support a circular economy.</p>

            <h2>Steps to Recycle Plastic</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Identify recyclable plastics:</strong> Most plastics have a recycling symbol with a number (1-7) indicating the type. Common recyclable plastics include PET (#1), HDPE (#2), and PP (#5). Check your local recycling guidelines for accepted types.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Clean your plastics:</strong> Rinse bottles, containers, and packaging to remove food, liquids, or residue. Dirty plastics can contaminate recycling batches and may be sent to landfill.<br><br>
                <strong>3. Sort by type:</strong> Separate plastics by number and type if required by your local facility. Mixing types can lower the quality of recycled material.<br><br>
                <strong>4. Remove caps, labels, and seals:</strong> Some recycling centers require you to remove caps, labels, and seals, as they may be made from different materials.<br><br>
                <strong>5. Flatten and compact:</strong> Crush bottles and containers to save space in your recycling bin.<br><br>
                <strong>6. Drop off or curbside:</strong> Place plastics in your curbside recycling bin or take them to a local recycling center. Some stores offer drop-off bins for plastic bags and wraps.<br><br>
                <strong>7. Avoid non-recyclables:</strong> Items like plastic straws, utensils, and polystyrene foam (Styrofoam) are often not accepted. Check with your local program.<br><br>
                <strong>8. Support recycling programs:</strong> Participate in community cleanups, educate others, and advocate for better recycling infrastructure.

            <h2>Plastic Information</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>What is Plastic?</strong><br>
                Plastic is a synthetic material made from polymers derived mainly from petroleum and natural gas. It is lightweight, durable, flexible, and resistant to water, making it ideal for packaging, construction, electronics, and more.<br><br>
                <strong>Types of Plastics:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate, #1):</strong> Used in water and soda bottles, food packaging. Highly recyclable.</li>
                    <li><strong>HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene, #2):</strong> Used in milk jugs, detergent bottles, and toys. Strong and recyclable.</li>
                    <li><strong>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride, #3):</strong> Used in pipes, window frames, and medical equipment. Difficult to recycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene, #4):</strong> Used in plastic bags, shrink wrap, and squeezable bottles. Sometimes recyclable at drop-off locations.</li>
                    <li><strong>PP (Polypropylene, #5):</strong> Used in yogurt containers, bottle caps, and straws. Increasingly recyclable.</li>
                    <li><strong>PS (Polystyrene, #6):</strong> Used in disposable cups, plates, and foam packaging. Rarely recycled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other (#7):</strong> Includes mixed or layered plastics, such as polycarbonate and bioplastics. Recycling options are limited.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Plastic Lifecycle:</strong><br>
                Plastics are produced, used, and often discarded after a single use. Only about 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled. The rest ends up in landfills, incinerators, or the environment.<br><br>
                <strong>Innovations:</strong><br>
                Advances in biodegradable plastics, chemical recycling, and upcycling are helping reduce plastic waste and create new products from old plastics.

            <h2>Harms of Plastic</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Environmental Harm:</strong><br>
                - <strong>Pollution:</strong> Plastic waste accumulates in landfills, rivers, and oceans. Over 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, forming massive garbage patches.<br>
                - <strong>Wildlife Impact:</strong> Animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, leading to injury, starvation, or death. Microplastics are found in fish, birds, and even plankton.<br>
                - <strong>Long Decomposition:</strong> Most plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to break down, persisting in the environment and releasing toxic chemicals.<br><br>
                <strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>
                - <strong>Microplastics:</strong> Tiny plastic particles are found in water, food, and air. They can enter the human body and may cause inflammation, hormone disruption, and other health issues.<br>
                - <strong>Toxic Chemicals:</strong> Some plastics contain additives like BPA, phthalates, and flame retardants, which can leach into food and water and affect human health.<br><br>
                <strong>Resource Use:</strong><br>
                - <strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong> Plastic production uses large amounts of oil and natural gas, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.<br>
                - <strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Manufacturing and transporting plastics require significant energy, increasing the carbon footprint.<br><br>
                <strong>Social Impact:</strong><br>
                - <strong>Waste Management Costs:</strong> Communities spend billions managing plastic waste and cleaning up pollution.<br>
                - <strong>Inequity:</strong> Plastic pollution disproportionately affects low-income and coastal communities.
